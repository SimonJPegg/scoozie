An Oozie artefact builder library for scala.  it was created to allow developers  to quickly generate new Oozie artefacts without copy/pasting XML and avoiding typos in the XML they create.

Scoozie was created with CDH in mind and supports oozie version 4.1.0. 
 

## Usage 
Scoozie provides two modes of interaction

  * A [Scala API](./ScalaAPI.md)
  * A [Hocon API](HoconAPI.md)

See the above links for more information.

*Note:*  There appears to be an issue with submitting workflows/coordinators generated by this library via hue.
Any variables containing the '=' symbol such as hive parameters are not picked up when the workflow is submitted.
For now, it is recommended to submit via the command line.
